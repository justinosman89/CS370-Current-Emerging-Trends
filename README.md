Treasure Hunt Game: Deep Q-Learning Agent

Project Overview:
This project involves developing a reinforcement learning agent using deep Q-learning to navigate a maze and find a treasure before a pirate does. The agent learns from experience to determine the optimal path to the treasure, showcasing the application of key concepts in neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Provided code included: 
-TreasureMaze.py: Defines the maze environment and manages game state.
-GameExperience.py: Manages the storage and replay of episodes for agent learning.
-Notebook Setup: Initial code to set up the environment, visualize the maze, and simulate gameplay.

Code that I created:

-Deep Q-learning Algorithm:
Implemented the core algorithm, allowing the agent to learn and optimize its pathfinding strategy.
-Neural Network Model: Built a neural network using Keras to predict the best actions based on the agent's experiences.
-Training and Testing: Configured the model to train effectively and tested its ability to consistently find the treasure.
